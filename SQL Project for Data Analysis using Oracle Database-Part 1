# SQL Projects

Data Analysis:
● The Oracle Database 21c is downloaded from the Oracle website for SQL Data analysis.
● The SQL Developer is downloaded for working in Oracle databases, connecting it to the
“SYSTEM” username and creating tables in the database.
● Data is inserted into the tables, followed by the exploration of the tables, including a
walkthrough of columns and seeing comments.
● The listing of the Employees and Departments is done based on some conditions using the
SQL commands followed by displaying the records in an ordered manner and handling of the
NULL values.
● The selection of the records is made based on some patterns like Wildcard, Operators, etc
followed by implementation of the Data Manipulation commands(DML) like Add, Update and
Delete for the Data Analysis.
● The backup of the table where migration is going on is taken, followed by COMMIT and
ROLLBACK commands. Then the listing of distinct records is done, and further renaming of
the columns.
● Finally, a listing of the employee details based on the complex nested conditions is done.

Tech stack:
● SQL Programming language
● Oracle SQL Developer
