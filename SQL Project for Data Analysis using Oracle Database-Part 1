What is Dataset Analysis?
Dataset Analysis is defined as manipulating or processing unstructured data or raw data to draw
valuable insights and conclusions that will help derive critical decisions that will add some business
value. The dataset analysis process is followed by organizing the dataset, transforming the dataset,
visualizing the dataset, and finally modeling the dataset to derive predictions for solving the business
problems, making informed decisions, and effectively planning for the future.
